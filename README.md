Fulfill IQ is a personal project where I'm applying everything I've learned as a fullstack developerâ€”good practices, architecture, patterns, and clean code.

The core idea is to build a system that can predict how many orders a store can handle based on its location, schedule, and operational capacity. But beyond that, this project is my playground to test ideas, refine my skills, and build something solid, maintainable, and scalable.

Tech stack:
*Backend: NestJS + TypeORM

*Database: PostgreSQL

*Architecture: Clean code with SOLID principles and hexagonal architecture

*Prediction (coming soon): Basic statistical models to estimate order volume

*Geolocation: Polygon-based coverage using latitude and longitude

*Testing: Test-first approach (unit + integration)

*Docs: Swagger for API documentation and testing
